## Questions
do you also get the error message:

```bash
libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
```
?

To answer your questions:
    unfortunatly, yess... i do get that error


- DO WE NEED TO MAKE A FANCIER FUEL PLATFORM WITH:
  - platforms floating? 
  - do the spaceships takes damage if they collide with the platform? 
  - shall the spaceships only land upright on the platform to refuel? 

- Assignment says:
  - Each spaceship has a limited amount of fuel. To refuel, it must land
on one of two landing pads. Alternatively, you can put a ‚Äúfuel barrel‚Äù
at a random position that is collected by the first spaceship reaching
it.
